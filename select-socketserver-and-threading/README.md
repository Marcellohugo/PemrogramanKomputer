Fill your NRP and Name in profile.txt file.  

Implement simple multi-client chat servers using the `select`, `socketserver`, and `threading` modules.

Create two server files and one client file:

-   **server-socketserver.py**: Must use the `socketserver` module.
-   **server-select.py**: Must use the `select` module.
-   **client.py**: Must use the `threading` module.

You don't need to run both servers simultaneouslyâ€”only one at a time. However, each server should be able to handle multiple clients simultaneously and broadcast messages to all connected clients.

Additionally, clients should be able to send some commands:
- `/list`: to receive a list of currently connected clients.
- `/upload <filename>`: to upload a file to the server.
- `/download <filename>`: to download a file from the server.
